Scenario 1: 

You are working on files. 
You made some changes.
You committed the file.

	commit is unsuccesful because some other person uploaded a new file in the server.
	what to do?
	
	Push rejected.
	How many files have been modified?
	
	Do you want to keep your changes are do you want to remove them?
	
	
	Take a back up of the file for safety.
	Do a soft reset
	git reset --soft
	
Resolution :

if you want to keep the changes and just want to change the position of HEAD by n poisition

git reset --soft HEAD~n

if you want to change the position of HEAD and revert the changes as well.

git reset --hard HEAD~n
